Hi.
This is a simple movie app built with Kotlin. 

The app features two pages: a welcoming page and a movie list page, accessible by clicking the "Get In" button.

It retrieves data from an API and displays movie posters by using Coil library, along with their titles. You can scroll down to view more content on the movie list page.

During data retrieval, the app displays a progress bar with the text "Loading" to indicate that content is being loaded.
It also handles possible errors during data retrieval.

The architecture follows the MVVM pattern, and pagination is implemented for efficient data handling. 

Thank you.
